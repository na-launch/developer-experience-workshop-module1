* Faster Onboarding: Reduce the “first week setup” pain by having environments, docs, and sample projects ready to go.
* Standardization Without Friction: Use pre-built, org-approved templates and CI/CD flows while still focusing on coding
* Discoverability: Search and explore services, APIs, and libraries published by peers across the org.
* Developer Experience Boost: Spend more time building features, less time chasing config, secrets, or repo links.
